 <h1 class="fonts">1. Markup languages</h1>

<p>A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>
Types of markup languages:<br>
<ul>
<li>Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</li>
<li>Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</li>
<li>Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="fonts">1.2. HTML</h2>

<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>

<p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>

<h3 class="fonts">1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>1. The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
<li>2. The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
<li>3. A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
<li>4. The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
</ol>
